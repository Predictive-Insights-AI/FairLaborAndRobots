# Take the contents of my resume, and use it to write a short article.  Use "I" language saying that htese are things that i personally did:

Script:

hank you for applying for the LinkedIn ghostwriting role! As the next step, I’d love for you to create a short sample post for us. Here’s what I’m looking for:

It should match the tone and style of our current top-performing posts. (You can take inspiration from our current linkedin posts). BUT it needs to bring a fresh, innovative perspective related to data engineering — ideally something that sparks conversation, introduces a new idea, or shares a strong opinion (I want to read it and learn something new). The post should feel authentic, insightful, and easily digestible for a LinkedIn audience. Please do not use chat gpt.

Absolutely! Here’s a short LinkedIn-style article using “I” language and drawing directly from your resume, crafted to be conversational, insightful, and innovative-perfect for a ghostwriting sample on data engineering.

## Why Data Engineers Should Think Like Product Builders

In data engineering, the difference between "good enough" and game-changing often comes down to treating your work like a product, not just a pipeline.

For example, when I was contracting as a Data Analyst at Expedia Group, I didn’t just optimize 600TB big data architectures for compliance-though reducing costs by 50% with distributed computing felt great. I approached every dashboard, every ETL process, and every API integration as if I were delivering a product to end-users. This meant prioritizing clear communication, rigorous testing automation, and creating dynamic Tableau visualizations that helped teams make real-time, globally-impactful decisions.

As the founder of ExamPA.net, I built an entire ed-tech business on top of data pipelines that ingested, validated, and transformed synthetic actuarial datasets. I designed these systems to scale-ultimately serving 15,000+ users and supporting a 12% conversion rate. The result? Customers could trust the quality of the data *and* the insights, reducing their study time by half.

Even in consulting work, I've learned the value of crafting data infrastructure that adapts to real user feedback. Building a CRM workflow for BeyondMCB wasn't just about integrating data sources-it was about enabling decision-makers to wake up, check HubSpot, and know they had everything they needed in one place.

The lesson: Whether optimizing SQL scripts down from 600 lines to 50, automating GLM model monitoring for national insurers, or collaborating in Agile teams, I always ask, “How does this help the end user?” That question leads to better validation, smarter automation, and more resilient infrastructure-qualities that modern data engineering desperately needs.

If you treat your data products with the same care as customer-facing apps-from system monitoring to presentation-your impact multiplies. In a world hungry for reliable, actionable insights, isn’t it time we start building data solutions with the product mindset our stakeholders deserve?
